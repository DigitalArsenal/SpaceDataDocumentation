## Overview

Data is *hard*.  After all, information technology is the art of using mathematics to describe the real world, then presenting the result in a way that is palatable to the human mind.  It is a magic trick that happens transparently every day, trillions of times on billions of computers across the world.  It's even happening right now, as you read this text. 

Behind the slick user interfaces, crisp icons, and shiny buttons, there is always a data interface that started out *not quite right*, and hacked on from there. If a strict deadline is involved, the hacks can get downright dirty.  While the "how" can get messy, the "what" is usually standardized to keep things easy to integrate, repeatable, extendable, and maintainable. Usually, there is a broad consensus on what constitutes an **"industry standard"** for data.  Sometimes it is created by a standards organization such as the [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](https://www.ietf.org/) or the [Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)](https://www.ieee.org/). Sometimes, however, the standard is emergent based on the needs of the community.

 Take the telephone number, a data standard that underpins most modern communications technology.  Originally proposed in 1879 by a physician, Dr. Parker, it was an answer to the familiar problem of a virus taking down a network. In this instance, the virus was measles, and the phone network contained human operators, manually connecting customers by name. Assigning numbers to the connection ports allowed new operators to be quickly trained in case the current operators fell ill.

Phone numbers evolved through the years as human operators were replaced by automated switch boards, digital networks replaced analog, and so forth. Early digital networks used analog phone networks and modems dialing phone numbers to allow computers to connect to the internet.
