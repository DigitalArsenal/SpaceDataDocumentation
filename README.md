## Overview

<br/>

Data is _hard_. Information technology is the art of using mathematics to describe the real world, then presenting the result in a way that is palatable to the human mind. It is a magic trick that happens transparently every day, trillions of times on billions of computers across the world. It's even happening right now, on your computer, as you read this text.

Behind the slick user interfaces, crisp icons, and shiny buttons, there is always a data interface that started out _not quite right_, and hacked on from there. If a strict deadline is involved, the hacks can get downright dirty. While the "how" can get messy, the "what" is usually standardized to keep things easy to integrate, repeatable, extendable, and maintainable. Usually, there is a broad consensus on what constitutes an **"industry standard"** for data. Sometimes it is created by a standards organization such as the [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](https://www.ietf.org/) or the [Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)](https://www.ieee.org/). Sometimes, however, the standard is emergent based on the needs of the community.

Consider the telephone number, a data standard that underpins most modern communications technology. Originally proposed in 1879 by a physician, Dr. Parker, it was an answer a familiar problem: a network going offline due to a virus. In this instance, the virus was measles, and the phone network contained human operators, manually connecting [customers by name](https://atcaonline.com/the-great-lowell-measles-epidemic-or-how-the-telephone-number-was-invented/). Assigning numbers to the connection ports allowed new operators to be quickly trained in case the current operators fell ill.

Phone numbers evolved through the years as automated switch boards replaced human operators, digital networks replaced analog, and so forth. Early digital networks used analog phone networks and modems dialing phone numbers to allow computers to connect to the internet.  At every step, manufacturers, developers, integrators, and government officials created local standards that described what constituted a valid phone number, what to do if an invalid phone number is entered, and how to handle interactions with legacy systems.  In 1984, over 100 years after its creation, the telephone number was finally standardized internationally using the standard [E.163/Q.11](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.163/en).
